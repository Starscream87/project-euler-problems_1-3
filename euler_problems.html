				<h2>Multiples of 3 and 5</h2>
				<p>
					If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9.<br /> 
					The sum of these multiples is 23.<br />
					Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

				<h2>Even Fibonacci Numbers</h2>
				<p> 
					Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, 
					the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...<br />
					By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
